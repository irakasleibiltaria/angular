## Install

Option one: Only install the library

$ npm install angular@1.3.11
```

Option two: The seed contains a sample AngularJS application and is preconfigured to install the Angular framework and a bunch of development and testing tools for instant web development gratification.

New project without the angular-seed commit history then you can do
```
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/angular/angular-seed.git <your-project-name>
```
